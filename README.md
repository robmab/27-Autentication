# REST Star Wars User Security Endpoints

![Proyecto sin título](https://github.com/robmab/SW_Security_Endpoints/assets/56076087/f6620008-e641-4634-bd54-5f7557dc4dba)

### Features
- Signup
  - Endpoint of **user registration**, with check in case the user or email already exists in the database. Password registration will be **encrypted via JWT**.
- Login
  - Checking both by **email or username** that they exist, and checking that the password matches the one registered. A JWT function will be used to do this so as not to decrypt it and thus not to compromise the security of the user. Additionally, a **token** will be created and stored in the user's LocalStorage to verify that the user is logged in.
- Private
  - By using a **JWT decorator**, the user's profile entry is protected. You will only be able to log in if you have saved your token (in other worlds, if you are logged in).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> In all cases, checks will be made of the data submitted, as well as the type of data, in order to record all possible **types of errors**
